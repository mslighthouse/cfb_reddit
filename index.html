<p>This is a project page dedicated to the information related to <a href="https://reddit.com/r/CFB">/r/CFB</a>'s 2016 National Championship Threads. The project aims to collect information regarding the comments and format them in ways for people to see interaction, post amount, and other information.</p>

<a id="collecting-data" class="anchor" href="#collecting-data" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Collecting Data</h2>

<p>Data was collected via a python script (<a href="https://github.com/mslighthouse/reddit_cfb/blob/master/collect_comments.py">collect_comments.py</a>) and all comment related data was placed into an sqlite database. Then, another python scrip (<a href="https://github.com/mslighthouse/reddit_cfb/blob/master/analyzer.py">analyze.py</a>) took the information and either printed out relevant info via Command Line or posted into an Excel document. Though the .xlsx file is not included in the repo, it can be easily recreated for your individual viewing by downloading the repo.</p>

<a id="analysis-via-flair" class="anchor" href="#analysis-via-flair" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Analysis via Flair</h2>

<p>One of the most interesting things about /r/CFB is the inclusion of flairs. Any user can request a representation of their collegiate team up to two teams to be displayed with every post of theirs (in the subreddit). This is a way to see what type of fans post in the thread. I looked at individuals with Alabama related flair, Clemson related flair, SEC Team or conference flair, and ACC Team or conference flair. The results were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Alabama related flairs: 550</li>
<li>Clemson related flairs: 268</li>
<li>Alabama AND Clemson flairs: 4</li>
<li>SEC team / conference flairs: 1,298</li>
<li>ACC team / conference flairs: 762</li>
</ul>

<p>Interesting enough, 4 individuals had an Alabama AND Clemson related flair for them, listed below. </p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://reddit.com/user/HydroSword">/u/HydroSword</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://reddit.com/user/WilliePC">/u/WilliePC</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://reddit.com/user/drharris">/u/drharris</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://reddit.com/user/makeupedge">/u/makeupedge</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It should be noted that all 4 had the order Alabama Crimson Tide / Clemson Tigers as compared to the other way around.</p>
<p>The Alabama fans pretty significantly outnumbered the Clemson fans. The Alabama and Clemson related flairs do <em>NOT</em> include the 3 individuals representing both, as I have placed those three in a different category. However, the SEC and ACC counts DO account for the 3. I've graphed the relationship of SEC/Alabama vs ACC/Clemson fans representation below:</p>

<a id="analysis-via-users-and-comments" class="anchor" href="#analysis-via-users-and-comments" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Analysis via Users and Comments</h2>

<p>The comments themselves are also an interesting place to find discussion. In fact, there were <em>5,851 unique users</em> who contributed <em>41,667 total comments</em>. Of those 41,667 comments, only 336 have been deleted. The top 5 highest posters, though, were as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ephenssta">/u/ephenssta</a> posted 336 times</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BamaFan87">/u/BamaFan87</a> posted 279 times</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SomeTimesY">/u/SomeTimesY</a> posted 207 times</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DoctorHolliday">/u/DoctorHolliday</a> posted 175 times</li></li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ke5eaj">/u/ke5eaj</a> posted 169 times</li>
</ul>

<p>The rest of the users, as well as post count, are formatted in the spreadsheet run by analyze.py. Here, however, is a bar chart of how many users posted a certain amount of times. You're free to zoom in and observe the axes to see all data.</p>
<div>
    <a href="https://plot.ly/~mslighthouse/18/" target="_blank" title="Users graphed with Post Count" style="display: block; text-align: center;"><img src="https://plot.ly/~mslighthouse/18.png" alt="Users graphed with Post Count" style="max-width: 100%;width: 929px;"  width="929" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https://plot.ly/404.png';" /></a>
    <script data-plotly="mslighthouse:18"  src="https://plot.ly/embed.js" async></script>
</div>
<p> The graph is incredibly skewed to lower post counts by individual users.</p>
<p> Also interesting is the frequency of posts per minute, shown below.</p>
<div>
    <a href="https://plot.ly/~mslighthouse/16/" target="_blank" title="Comments per Minute throughout National Championship Threads" style="display: block; text-align: center;"><img src="https://plot.ly/~mslighthouse/16.png" alt="Comments per Minute throughout National Championship Threads" style="max-width: 100%;width: 1083px;"  width="1083" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https://plot.ly/404.png';" /></a>
    <script data-plotly="mslighthouse:16"  src="https://plot.ly/embed.js" async></script>
</div>

<p> Spikes in posts / minute tend to occur on every score as well as leading into the next quarter. The largest spike occured right after the Alabama Onside Kick.</p> 
<p><b>NOTE: I'M LOOKING FOR AN ACTUAL TIME REPRESENTATION OF WHEN THE GAME OCCURED (COMMERCIAL BREAKS INCLUDED) SO THAT I CAN ACCURATELY ASSOCIATE THE SPIKES WITH GAME EVENTS. PLEASE EMAIL ME BELOW IF YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION OR SOURCE(S)</b>.</p>

<h2>
<a id="comments-and-topic" class="anchor" href="#comments-and-topic" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Comments and topic</h2>

<p>I also decided to check for certain keywords in comments (swear-word warning ahead!). So, if a comment contained an instance or close relative to any of the keywords, it was counted. Here's the results</p>

<ul>
<li>Comments related to Alabama: 3052</li>
<li>Comments related to Clemson: 3475</li>
<li>Comments saying a variant of "fuck": 2650</li>
<li>Comments saying a variant of "shit": 1475</li>
<li>Comments mentioning Derrick Henry: 594</li>
<li>Comments mentioning Deshaun Watson: 1077</li>
<li>Comments talking about a touchdown: 267</li>
<li>Comments with the word onside: 425</li>
</ul>
